# Development Plan: Spotify Wrapped Booster

## Overview

The Spotify Wrapped Booster app is designed to optimize your Spotify Wrapped by intelligently managing playback to meet specific song and hour requirements. It runs seamlessly in the background, with a machine learning component to predict user activity and playback behavior.

---

## Project Components

### 1. Backend Server

- **Purpose**: Manage Spotify authentication and provide APIs for user data and token refresh.
- **Technology**: Python (FastAPI/Flask) or Node.js.
- **Key Features**:
  - OAuth2 integration with Spotify.
  - API endpoints for:
    - Fetching user data.
    - Refreshing tokens.
  - JSON or MongoDB storage for user tokens and settings.

### 2. Frontend/Desktop App

- **Purpose**: User interface for preferences, status, and scheduling.
- **Technology Options**:
  - **Desktop**: Python (PyQt/Tkinter) or Java (JavaFX).
  - **Web**: ReactJS or HTML/CSS + Flask/FastAPI for backend APIs.
- **Key Features**:
  - Minimal GUI with settings and playback tracking.
  - System tray support for Windows (runs in background).
  - Auto-start on boot.

### 3. Background Scheduler

- **Purpose**: Manage song playback and ensure background operation.
- **Technology**: Python `schedule` library or `threading`.
- **Key Features**:
  - Automates playback when user is inactive.
  - Integrates with machine learning model to predict user activity.

### 4. Machine Learning Model

- **Purpose**: Predict user activity for smarter playback scheduling.
- **Technology**: Python (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch).
- **Key Features**:
  - Train a model on user activity data (login/logout times).
  - Dynamically adjust playback schedule based on predictions.

### 5. Database

- **Purpose**: Store user preferences, playback logs, and credentials.
- **Technology Options**:
  - JSON file for local desktop storage.
  - MongoDB for web-based scalability.
- **Key Features**:
  - Save user tokens and preferences.
  - Track playback hours and song statistics.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Backend Development

1. Set up Spotify authentication using OAuth2.
2. Create APIs to fetch user data and refresh tokens.
3. Test token handling and storage with a sample JSON/MongoDB setup.

### Phase 2: Frontend/Desktop App

1. Build a basic GUI with user preferences and playback status.
2. Add system tray integration for Windows.
3. Connect to the backend for user authentication and settings.

### Phase 3: Playback Scheduler

1. Implement a background playback mechanism using threading or scheduling.
2. Ensure playback runs without interrupting user activities.

### Phase 4: Machine Learning Integration

1. Collect user activity data (e.g., login/logout times).
2. Train a time-series model to predict activity patterns.
3. Integrate predictions into the playback scheduler.

### Phase 5: Testing and Deployment

1. Test the complete workflow:
   - User authentication.
   - Playback scheduling.
   - Machine learning predictions.
2. Package the desktop app for distribution using PyInstaller or equivalent tools.
